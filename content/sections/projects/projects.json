      "description": "The thesis project focused on developing a machine learning pipeline for precise prediction of conceptual costs in construction projects. Extensive research was conducted to explore diverse models including Support Vector Regression, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Methods. By utilizing the Bagging technique and working with a variety of datasets, significant improvements were achieved in the accuracy of the models. This research highlights expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and research methodology, demonstrating the capability to apply advanced techniques to real-world problems and generate valuable insights.",
